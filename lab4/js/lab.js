//Rock-Paper-Scissors: 

//Get yourself two players, or one and play a AI 

//In this game there is a cyclical dependency, each one needs each other to create an outcome, in this case it's gaining an outcome from the game win, or tie. Rock beats paper, paper beats rock, and rock beats scissors. The rules are set!

//Start off by having both players pick one symbol from the options Rock, Paper, or Scissors
  //Both players are now displaying their symbol (rock,paper,or scissors) 
  //We then reference out trust rules and make the appropriate call based on the outcomes 
  //If it was a tie then both player play until it results in a Win
//X player wins//
