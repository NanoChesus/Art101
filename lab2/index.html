			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were tasked with making a site called "hello world". we have our site 
						introduce its self to the world and we give a short introduction about ourselvs and partner.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>since I'm new to coding the most common problem that arose was just navigating through VScode and figuring out how to link CSS code, figuring out what CSS effects what HTML and so on. 
						but through trial and error i figured it along with some help from some friends. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It went tell, it didn't take as long as i thought and after a while I start to get in the groov of things and felt like I was learning how to speak and read HTML/CSS. I went into this assignment with enthusiasm because I have always thought learning how to code is so cool, and it is! it felt like learning a 3rd language. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> we finished out websites with our introductions and a new styalized CSS to give it some soul.</p>
