                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The challenge was to debug a lab we have previously done, and i found ti alot esier to do after taking a break from it and beign able to go back refreshed</p>

                <div class="minor-section">
                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p> It was really hard while working on the lab to figuer out how to keep the text horizontal so that it stays in a easy to read format. But as i stepped back I saw that it was easy I just neeeded to look at some refrences and start all over rather then working with code with mistakes that im trying to fix instead of just doing code that is right from the begining. </p>
